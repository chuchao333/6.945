5.1: The provided success function always returns #f, after printing out the
     current dictionary of assignments. The subcalls to match:segment for the
     variables x and y from match:list will only succeed (and call the provided
     success function) if all the free 'b values are consumed in the
     pattern. Further, because of the or in the match segment, when the first
     success (x consumes none, y consumes all) returns a #f value (because we
     gave a success function which always returns #f), it will continue on and
     try having x consume 1 'b, and so on and so forth until all possible
     choices for x are exhausted, at which case match:list gives up and returns
     #f.
