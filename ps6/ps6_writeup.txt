Problem 6.1: Lorna's father is Colonel Downing. There are 3 possible solutions
	if we don't know Mary Ann's father.

Problem 6.2B: I just printed on each subtree examined, and printed the phrase
	'exit when the program should have exited.

Problem 6.3: The difference arises from the order in which the two searches try
	alternatives. For this particular case, the answer is found sooner by
	depth-first traversal than by breadth-first. The extra calls to fail
	arise from the cases where there are no valid alternatives left for j
	and/or k given the current assignments of i and/or j. Finally,
	depth-first search won't work for AX 3.f because the search simply
	doesn't terminate, and so has infinite depth. It will spend forever
	trying to add all the possible values for i before ever moving onto
	setting values for j.

Problem 6.4A: An unordered AMB would be useful in implementing a stochastic
	search. For simplicity, I implemented a test that flips a coin n times.


Problem 6.5: The within-continuation only escapes local bindings of the current
	continuation, but not assignments in the global scope. Thus, the
	assignments to x, y, and z are "sticky", in that the last value assigned
	to them sticks, even though the continuation was defined with a
	different value for them. By comparison, in AX 1.b, the values are only
	defined locally and so they are escaped by the within-continuation
	invocation.
