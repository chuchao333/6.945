Problem 6.1: Lorna's father is Colonel Downing. There are 3 possible solutions
	if we don't know Mary Ann's father.


Problem 6.3: The difference arises from the order in which the two searches try
	alternatives. For this particular case, the answer is found sooner by
	depth-first traversal than by breadth-first. The extra calls to fail
	arise from the cases where there are no valid alternatives left for j
	and/or k given the current assignments of i and/or j. Finally,
	depth-first search won't work for AX 3.f because the search simply
	doesn't terminate, and so has infinite depth. It will spend forever
	trying to add all the possible values for i before ever moving onto
	setting values for j.
