Problem 4.3

Note - I could not easily run the multiple-dwelling problem as it was
provided. You can see the changes I needed to make in order to get it just to
run in the diffs.

Ex 4.38: There are 5 solutions to the modified puzzle

Ex 4.39: Reordering the require statments shouldn't make too much of a
   difference. A failed require statment will force a backtrack. Since all the
   require statements appear sequentially afterall variables have been assigned
   a value, failing an earlier require statement would save us from evaluating
   the conditionals in the later require statements. So if there is a particular
   requirement statement which will fail the most times in this evaluation, then
   we might save some time by putting that first. However, that is already the
   case, since our requirement that all assignments be unique is the first
   requirement. After that, we could put the requirements between pairs of
   variables earlier, but the expected time difference in this case would be
   negligible, not to mention that the additional computation in those may
   outweigh the benefit of putting them earlier.

Ex 4.40 There are 5^5=3125 assignments without the requirement that they be
   distinct. With the distinct requirement, there are 5!=120 assignments. See
   diff for the new procedure.
